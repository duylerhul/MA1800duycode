2) The spark for this project came from realizing how often people are completely unaware of what they click on online. I created a context based on a Terms and Conditions box that hides many secret terms under a mask of very simple, harmless text. Functionally, when users click inside the text, they are dragged into a hidden link that leads to different endings. My greatest struggle was actually the design of the website. I chose a retro hacker theme, but I found that getting that specific old-school look was much harder and more complicated to code than I originally thought.
3)My work was directly influenced by the work of  JODI (1996). I was drawn to their chaotic style, which uses the same kind of retro theme I aimed for. Their work inspired the functionality of my project, specifically the idea that clicking on the page would lead the user into a totally different digital dimension.
4) Looking back, I think I was too focused on the design of the web page and didn't get the chance to develop more diverse outcomes for when the user clicks the hidden link. If I had more time, I would definitely add more content to those endings. I also wanted to try and add my own custom images created in GIMP, but I found out too late that I wasn't familiar enough with the engine to successfully add them in.
